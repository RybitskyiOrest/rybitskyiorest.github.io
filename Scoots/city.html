      <h2>Ivano-Frankivsk in details</h2>
      <p>
        Ivano-Frankivsk received its current name in 1962 when during the celebration of 300 anniversary 
        of the foundation of the city it was renamed in honor of the outstanding Ukrainian writer Ivan Franko.
         By that time the city had been known as Stanislav and was named in honor of the son of the founder Andriy
          Revera Potocki (Pototski) — Stanislaw.<br><br>
        According to an old legend, the contours of the future city were outlined with a plow by the 
        founder of the city, a powerful man Revera Potocki (Pototski) when he was plowing the field. 
        While constructing the city, which emerged on the territory of the ancient settlement Zabolottia,
         the Potocki tried to implement urban construction Renaissance ideas of an “ideal city”. Therefore, 
         Stanislav was originally constructed as a mighty fortress for protection against raids of Crimean and
          Nogai hordes. Ivano-Frankivsk owes its economic and cultural development apart from Ukrainians and Poles
           also to Jews and Armenians, damage at the beginning of XVIII c., when it was burned to ashes during the
            Russian-Swedish war. As a result, the Stanislav fortress was dismantled for building materials; temples,
             palaces, 
        unassailable bastions, and the City Hall were destroyed.
